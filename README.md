# Inite INIT and IDEA Tokens

This project built using Hardhat framework. We build contracts from `contracts` folder. To deploy we use this command:

```
BSC_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY="2cb3ecac6a9b0358e43bd642687fe8baa1a9d4505e7305d35a41f0be350c9447" npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet
```

We need to add more networks here like Aurora / Polygon to build there as well. We need to have main / test networks script to deploy contracts there.
